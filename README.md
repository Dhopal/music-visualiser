# Music-Visualizer-Reboot 

  - Terminal-based Music Visualizer that displays the power spectrum of a .wav file
  - Music visualizer using SDL2 for audio play and FFTW for Fourier Transformation

# Motivation

  - Was planning to design and build a LED music visualizer as an Arduino project but wanted a better understanding of how music visualization software actually works.

# Software

  - SDL2: https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation
  - FFTW: http://www.fftw.org/download.html
  - pkg-config: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
  - avconv: https://libav.org/download/ if running debian based distro run "sudo apt-get install libav-tools"
  - GDB: for debugging on Linux
  - gcc: C compiler for Linux
  
# How To Build and Run

## From terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crelloc/Music-Visualizer-Reboot.git && cd Music-Visualizer-Reboot && make
```
## Synopsis:



```bash
./visual.exe [-f] /PATH/TO/WAV/AUDIO/FILE

For example:
./visual.exe -f ~/Music/Classic.wav
```
Note: Supports only mp3 or wav audio files.
# Brief overview about how the program works
  - Analyzes the digital information in the wav file.
  - Computes the fourier transformation every 'N' frames. Eg. computes the fourier transformation (FT) on 'N' L channel data and also computes the FT on 'N' R channel data.
  - Gathers frequency and magnitude information from the results of the fourier transformation and records it by storing into an array.
  - After analysis is finished the program will play music and display the corresponding information at the terminal.
